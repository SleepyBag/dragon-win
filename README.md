# DragonWindows

## Introduction

This is a simple tool for acting as a dragging source.
It is like [dragon](https://github.com/mwh/dragon), but for Windows.

## Usage

Put `DragonWindows.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable so that you can access it from terminal.

When you want to drag some files, for example, file `a.txt`, `b.py` and `C:\c.png`, just run `DragonWindows` with these files attached as arguments, like

```
DragonWindows a.txt b.py C:\c.png
```

Then a GUI window of these files will show and you can drag them from the window to any other places.
The window is demonstrated as below.
